# Getting Started

This guide will help you get started with {{ project_name }}.

## Installation

### Using pip

```bash
pip install {{ package_name }}
```

### Using uv

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a modern Python package manager that's much faster than pip.

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install the package
uv pip install {{ package_name }}
```

### From Source

To install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/{{ github_username }}/{{ project_slug }}.git
cd {{ project_slug }}
uv sync
```

## Basic Usage

Here's how to use {{ project_name }} in your project:

```python
from {{ package_name }}.example import hello

# Basic usage
greeting = hello()
print(greeting)  # Output: Hello, World!

# With custom name
greeting = hello("Python")
print(greeting)  # Output: Hello, Python!
```
